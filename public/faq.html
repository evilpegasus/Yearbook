                <h2>What is Yearbook 2020?</h2>
                <p>Yearbook 2020 is a web app created to let students and graduates sign each other's virtual yearbooks.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How do I use Yearbook 2020?</h2>
                <p>You can draw on your Yearbook 2020 page or your friends' pages by moving your mouse with the left mouse button held down or drawing with your fingers
                    or a stylus if you have a touchscreen. You can change the brush size and color using the dropdown menus at the bottom of the screen and you can access
                    the menu by clicking on the three lines at the top left corner.</p>
                <p>Make sure to respect others' signatures by not erasing or drawing over them!</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What do the buttons at the bottom of the screen do?</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Clear Changes</strong> button will clear all changes you have made to the Yearbook 2020 page you are on. This cannot be undone.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Download</strong> button will open your Yearbook 2020 page in a new tab as a PNG image ready to be saved. You can right click on the image and select "Save As"
                    to save it to your computer. You can print it once you have saved it to your computer. <strong>You can only download your own Yearbook 2020 page.</strong></p>
                <p>The <strong>Upload</strong> button will upload all changes you have made to the Yearbook 2020 page you are on to our servers. These changes can be viewed by anyone who has access to the page.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Get Image</strong> button will update the Yearbook 2020 page you are on with any changes that others have made since you loaded the page or last pressed the button.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How do I let my friends sign my page?</h2>

You can find your custom link by opening the menu at the top left and clicking <strong>Share your Yearbook</strong>. This will copy your personal link to your keyboard which you can send to your friends.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How do I sign my friend's yearbook pages?</h2>
                <p>Ask them for their custom link. You can only access pages that you have a link to.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Who built Yearbook 2020?</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>Yearbook 2020 was built by Hazen High School 2020 graduates <a class="name" href="https://mingyfong.github.io/" target="_blank">Ming Fong</a> and <a class="name" href="https://arnavthareja.github.io" target="_blank">Arnav Thareja</a>.</p>

                <h2>Why is the sky blue?</h2>
                <p>Gases and particles in Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How are babies made?</h2>
                <p>Ask your parents.</p>
