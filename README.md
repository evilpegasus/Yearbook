# Usage

## Signing in
You must use either a Google account or a Facebook account to authenticate. You cannot access the app without authenticating. More sign in options may be added in the future.

## How to use Yearbook
To draw, select a color or the eraser and click and drag on the white canvas. Lines will be drawn while the left mouse button is held down. The thickness and color of the line can be changed using the **Toolbar** menu at the bottom of the screen. The **Clear Changes** button will clear all changes you have made to the canvas.

When you have finished drawing, click the **Upload** button to save your changes to our servers. The **Update Page** button will update the canvas to reflect any changes to the canvas that may have happened since the last update. This will not overwrite your changes.

## Sharing Yearbooks
You can share your Yearbook page by opening the menu in the top left and selecting **Share your Yearbook**. This will copy a custom link to your page to your clipboard. You can then share this link with other people. **Anyone with your link can write on your page.** Only share your link with people you trust. You can access your friends' Yearbooks through the custom links they send you.

## Saving your Yearbook  
To download your yearbook page, open the **Toolbar** at the bottom of your page and select **Download**. A link to a picture of your page will be emailed to the email you signed in with. You can then save the picture locally.

## Supported Devices  
Any computer running a modern web browser will be able to access Yearbook. Touchscreen devices are recommended, as drawing with a mouse/trackpad may be difficult. Touchscreen devices will only be able to touch scroll if touched outside the canvas.
