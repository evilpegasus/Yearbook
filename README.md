## Signing in
You must use either a Google account or a Facebook account to authenticate. You cannot access the app without authenticating.

## How to use Yearbook
To draw, select a color or the eraser and click and drag on the white canvas. Lines will be drawn while the left mouse button is held down. The thickness and color of the line can be changed using the dropdown menus at the bottom of the screen. The clear button will clear all changes you have made to the canvas. You can access your friends' Yearbooks through the custom links they send you.  

## Saving your Yearbook  
The download button will download a copy of the canvas as a .png image file for you to save locally on your computer. The upload button will upload a copy of the canvas to our servers so you can access it again later. The Get Image button will update the canvas to reflect any changes to the canvas that may have happened since the last update. The Get Image button will not overwrite your changes.  

## Supported Devices  
Any computer running a modern web browser will be able to access Yearbook. Touchscreen devices are recommended, as drawing with a mouse/trackpad may be difficult. Touchscreen devices will only be able to touch scroll if touched outside the canvas.

Yearbook 2020 is a work in progress. If you want to contribute, please send us a pull request.
